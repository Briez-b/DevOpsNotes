# Monitoring

## Metrics vs Monitoring

Metrics are measurements or data points that tell you what is happening. For example, the number of steps you walk each day, your heart rate, or the temperature outside‚Äîthese are all metrics.

Monitoring is the process of keeping an eye on these metrics over time to understand what‚Äôs normal, identify changes, and detect problems. It's like watching your step count daily to see if you're meeting your fitness goal or checking your heart rate to make sure it's in a healthy range.

## üöÄ Prometheus
- Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit originally built at SoundCloud.
- It is known for its robust data model, powerful query language (PromQL), and the ability to generate alerts based on the collected time-series data.
- It can be configured and set up on both bare-metal servers and container environments like Kubernetes.

## üè† Prometheus Architecture
- The architecture of Prometheus is designed to be highly flexible, scalable, and modular.
- It consists of several core components, each responsible for a specific aspect of the monitoring process.

### üî• Prometheus Server
- Prometheus server is the core of the monitoring system. It is responsible for scraping metrics from various configured targets, storing them in its time-series database (TSDB), and serving queries through its HTTP API.
- Components:
    - **Retrieval**: This module handles the scraping of metrics from endpoints, which are discovered either through static configurations or dynamic service discovery methods.
    - **TSDB (Time Series Database)**: The data scraped from targets is stored in the TSDB, which is designed to handle high volumes of time-series data efficiently.
    - **HTTP Server**: This provides an API for querying data using PromQL, retrieving metadata, and interacting with other components of the Prometheus ecosystem.
- **Storage**: The scraped data is stored on local disk (HDD/SSD) in a format optimized for time-series data.

### üåê Service Discovery
- Service discovery automatically identifies and manages the list of scrape targets (i.e., services or applications) that Prometheus monitors.
- This is crucial in dynamic environments like Kubernetes where services are constantly being created and destroyed.
- Components:
    - **Kubernetes**: In Kubernetes environments, Prometheus can automatically discover services, pods, and nodes using Kubernetes API, ensuring it monitors the most up-to-date list of targets.
    - **File SD (Service Discovery)**: Prometheus can also read static target configurations from files, allowing for flexibility in environments where dynamic service discovery is not used.

### üì§ Pushgateway
- The Pushgateway is used to expose metrics from short-lived jobs or applications that cannot be scraped directly by Prometheus.
- These jobs push their metrics to the Pushgateway, which then makes them available for Prometheus to scrape(pull).
- Use Case:
    - It's particularly useful for batch jobs or tasks that have a limited lifespan and would otherwise not have their metrics collected.

### üö® Alertmanager
- The Alertmanager is responsible for managing alerts generated by the Prometheus server.
- It takes care of deduplicating, grouping, and routing alerts to the appropriate notification channels such as PagerDuty, email, or Slack.

### üß≤ Exporters
- Exporters are small applications that collect metrics from various third-party systems and expose them in a format Prometheus can scrape. They are essential for monitoring systems that do not natively support Prometheus.
- Types of Exporters:
    - Common exporters include the Node Exporter (for hardware metrics), the MySQL Exporter (for database metrics), and various other application-specific exporters.

### üñ•Ô∏è Prometheus Web UI
- The Prometheus Web UI allows users to explore the collected metrics data, run ad-hoc PromQL queries, and visualize the results directly within Prometheus.

### üìä Grafana
- Grafana is a powerful dashboard and visualization tool that integrates with Prometheus to provide rich, customizable visualizations of the metrics data.

### üîå API Clients
- API clients interact with Prometheus through its HTTP API to fetch data, query metrics, and integrate Prometheus with other systems or custom applications.

# üõ†Ô∏è  Installation & Configurations
## üì¶ Step 1: Create EKS Cluster

### Prerequisites
- Download and Install AWS Cli - Please Refer [this]("https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html") link.
- Setup and configure AWS CLI using the `aws configure` command.
- Install and configure eksctl using the steps mentioned [here]("https://eksctl.io/installation/").
- Install and configure kubectl as mentioned [here]("https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/").


```bash
eksctl create cluster --name=observability \
                      --region=us-east-1 \
                      --zones=us-east-1a,us-east-1b \
                      --without-nodegroup
```
```bash
eksctl utils associate-iam-oidc-provider \
    --region us-east-1 \
    --cluster observability \
    --approve
```
```bash
eksctl create nodegroup --cluster=observability \
                        --region=us-east-1 \
                        --name=observability-ng-private \
                        --node-type=t3.medium \
                        --nodes-min=2 \
                        --nodes-max=3 \
                        --node-volume-size=20 \
                        --managed \
                        --asg-access \
                        --external-dns-access \
                        --full-ecr-access \
                        --appmesh-access \
                        --alb-ingress-access \
                        --node-private-networking

# Update ./kube/config file
aws eks update-kubeconfig --name observability
```

### üß∞ Step 2: Install kube-prometheus-stack
```bash
helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update
```

### üöÄ Step 3: Deploy the chart into a new namespace "monitoring"
```bash
kubectl create ns monitoring
```
```bash
cd day-2

helm install monitoring prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack \
-n monitoring \
-f ./custom_kube_prometheus_stack.yml
```

### ‚úÖ Step 4: Verify the Installation
```bash
kubectl get all -n monitoring
```
- **Prometheus UI**:
```bash
kubectl port-forward service/prometheus-operated -n monitoring 9090:9090
```
- **Grafana UI**: password is `prom-operator`
```bash
kubectl port-forward service/monitoring-grafana -n monitoring 8080:80
```
- **Alertmanager UI**:
```bash
kubectl port-forward service/alertmanager-operated -n monitoring 9093:9093
```

### üßº Step 5: Clean UP
- **Uninstall helm chart**:
```bash
helm uninstall monitoring --namespace monitoring
```
- **Delete namespace**:
```bash
kubectl delete ns monitoring
```
- **Delete Cluster & everything else**:
```bash
eksctl delete cluster --name observability
```



# PRACTICE

First let's create EKS cluster
1) Install eksctl: https://eksctl.io/installation/

![](../Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020241016154103.png)

2) Create cluster

I got error:
![](../Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020241016154635.png)

Seems I need to add policies for my kops user.

![](../Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020241016160009.png)

It didn't work because I forgot some other permission. I didn't investigate what else, so I just added administrator policy to kops user.

3) Add oidc and nodes to cluster.

![](../Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020241017111725.png)

``` shell
# Update ./kube/config file
aws eks update-kubeconfig --name test-cluster-observability
```

Now I can see my nodes with kubectl. All work as expected
4) Install prometheus. Use some script from Abhishek repository for custom configuration of kube-prometheus-stack
``` shell
helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
helm install monitoring prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack \
-n monitoring \
-f ./custom_kube_prometheus_stack.yml
```

5) **Verify installation**
   
```bash
kubectl get all -n monitoring
```
- **Prometheus UI**:
```bash
kubectl port-forward service/prometheus-operated -n monitoring 9090:9090
```
- **Grafana UI**: password is `prom-operator`
```bash
kubectl port-forward service/monitoring-grafana -n monitoring 8080:80
```
- **Alertmanager UI**:
```bash
kubectl port-forward service/alertmanager-operated -n monitoring 9093:9093
```

And I can see all the resources on AWS console:
![](../Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020241017125737.png)

Instead port-forward better use ingress controller. I did such thing before. 


### üßº Step 5: Clean UP
- **Uninstall helm chart**:
```bash
helm uninstall monitoring --namespace monitoring
```
- **Delete namespace**:
```bash
kubectl delete ns monitoring
```
- **Delete Cluster & everything else**:
```bash
eksctl delete cluster --name observability
```
