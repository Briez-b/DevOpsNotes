# Arithmetic Operations in Python

## Introduction

Arithmetic operators in Python allow you to perform basic mathematical calculations on numeric values. These operators include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more.

## List of Arithmetic Operators

1. **Addition (+):** Adds two numbers.
2. **Subtraction (-):** Subtracts the right operand from the left operand.
3. **Multiplication (*):** Multiplies two numbers.
4. **Division (/):** Divides the left operand by the right operand (results in a floating-point number).
5. **Floor Division (//):** Divides the left operand by the right operand and rounds down to the nearest whole number.
6. **Modulus (%):** Returns the remainder of the division of the left operand by the right operand.
7. **Exponentiation (**):** Raises the left operand to the power of the right operand.

5. ￼￼Greater than or equal to (>=):￼￼ Checks if the left operand is gr
## Examples

### Addition

```python
a = 5
b = 3
result = a + b
print(result)  # Output: 8
```

### Subtraction

```python
x = 10
y = 7
result = x - y
print(result)  # Output: 3
```

# Assignment Operations in Python

## Introduction

Assignment operators in Python are used to assign values to variables. They include the basic assignment operator (=) and various compound assignment operators that perform an operation on the variable while assigning a value.

## List of Assignment Operators

1. **Basic Assignment (=):** Assigns a value to a variable.

2. **Addition Assignment (+=):** Adds the right operand to the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

3. **Subtraction Assignment (-=):** Subtracts the right operand from the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

4. **Multiplication Assignment (\*=):** Multiplies the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

5. **Division Assignment (/=):** Divides the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

6. **Floor Division Assignment (//=):** Performs floor division on the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

7. **Modulus Assignment (%=):** Calculates the modulus of the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

8. **Exponentiation Assignment (\*\*=):** Raises the left operand to the power of the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

## Examples

### Basic Assignment

```python
x = 5
```

### Addition Assignment

```python
y = 10
y += 3  # Equivalent to y = y + 3
```

# Bitwise Operations in Python

## Introduction

Bitwise operators in Python are used to perform operations on individual bits of binary numbers. These operators include bitwise AND, OR, XOR, and more.

## List of Bitwise Operators

1. **Bitwise AND (&):** Performs a bitwise AND operation on the binary representations of the operands.
2. **Bitwise OR (|):** Performs a bitwise OR operation.
3. **Bitwise XOR (^):** Performs a bitwise XOR operation.
4. **Bitwise NOT (~):** Flips the bits of the operand, changing 0 to 1 and 1 to 0.
5. **Left Shift (<<):** Shifts the bits to the left by a specified number of positions.
6. **Right Shift (>>):** Shifts the bits to the right.

## Examples

### Bitwise AND

```python
a = 5  # Binary: 0101
b = 3  # Binary: 0011
result = a & b  # Result: 0001 (Decimal: 1)
```

### Bitwise OR

```python
x = 10  # Binary: 1010
y = 7   # Binary: 0111
result = x | y  # Result: 1111 (Decimal: 15)
```

# Identity Operations in Python

## Introduction

Identity operators in Python are used to compare the memory locations of two objects to determine if they are the same object or not. The two identity operators are "is" and "is not."

## List of Identity Operators

1. **is:** Returns `True` if both operands refer to the same object.
2. **is not:** Returns `True` if both operands refer to different objects.

### Examples

#### is Operator

```python
x = [1, 2, 3]
y = x  # y now refers to the same object as x
result = x is y
# result will be True
```

#### is not Operator

```python
a = "hello"
b = "world"
result = a is not b
# result will be True
```

# Logical Operations in Python

## Introduction

Logical operators in Python are used to manipulate and combine Boolean values. These operators allow you to perform logical operations such as AND, OR, and NOT.

## List of Logical Operators

1. **AND (and):** Returns `True` if both operands are `True`.
2. **OR (or):** Returns `True` if at least one of the operands is `True`.
3. **NOT (not):** Returns the opposite Boolean value of the operand.

## Examples

### AND Operator

```python
x = True
y = False
result = x and y
# result will be False
```

### OR Operator

```python
a = True
b = False
result = a or b
# result will be True
```

# Membership Operations in Python

## Introduction

Membership operators in Python are used to check whether a value is present in a sequence or collection, such as a list, tuple, or string. The membership operators are "in" and "not in."

## List of Membership Operators

1. **in:** Returns `True` if the left operand is found in the sequence on the right.
2. **not in:** Returns `True` if the left operand is not found in the sequence on the right.

### Examples

#### in Operator

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
result = "banana" in fruits
# result will be True
```

#### not in Operator

```python
colors = ["red", "green", "blue"]
result = "yellow" not in colors
# result will be True
```

# Precedence of Operations in Python

## Introduction

Precedence of operations in Python defines the order in which different types of operators are evaluated in an expression. Operators with higher precedence are evaluated first.

## Examples

### Arithmetic Precedence

```python
result = 5 + 3 * 2
# Multiplication has higher precedence, so result is 11, not 16
```

# Relational Operations in Python

## Introduction

Relational operators in Python are used to compare two values and determine the relationship between them. These operators return a Boolean result, which is either `True` or `False`.

## List of Relational Operators

1. **Equal to (\==):** Checks if two values are equal.

2. **Not equal to (!=):** Checks if two values are not equal.

3. **Greater than (>):** Checks if the left operand is greater than the right operand.

4. **Less than (<):** Checks if the left operand is less than the right operand.

5. **Greater than or equal to (>=):** Checks if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.

6. **Less than or equal to (<=):** Checks if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.

## Examples

### Equal to

```python
a = 5
b = 5
result = a == b
# result will be True
```

### Not equal to

```python
x = 10
y = 7
result = x != y
# result will be True
```
