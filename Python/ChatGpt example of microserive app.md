Creating a C++ application with microservices is complex, but I can walk you through a simple conceptual example. Building microservices in C++ usually involves using frameworks for handling network communication (like gRPC, REST APIs) and containers (like Docker) for deploying each microservice independently. Below is a simplified illustration with 10 microservices for an e-commerce application.

### Application Overview
Imagine an e-commerce platform with these 10 microservices:

1. **User Service**: Manages user accounts and profiles.
2. **Product Service**: Manages product information.
3. **Inventory Service**: Tracks product stock levels.
4. **Order Service**: Handles customer orders.
5. **Payment Service**: Processes payments for orders.
6. **Notification Service**: Sends notifications to users (e.g., email, SMS).
7. **Shipping Service**: Manages shipping and tracking of orders.
8. **Cart Service**: Manages shopping cart functionality.
9. **Review Service**: Manages product reviews and ratings.
10. **Analytics Service**: Gathers and analyzes data for reporting.

Each service will expose a REST API, but in a real-world scenario, you could also use gRPC or another protocol for communication.

### Implementation Plan
For simplicity, I'll provide pseudo-code in C++ for one of the services (e.g., User Service) and outline how they communicate.

#### 1. User Service
This microservice manages user accounts. We'll use [Pistache](http://pistache.io/), a simple REST framework for C++, to create a basic REST API.

```cpp
// user_service.cpp
#include <pistache/endpoint.h>
#include <pistache/http.h>
#include <json/json.h>

using namespace Pistache;

class UserService {
public:
    void init() {
        Http::Endpoint endpoint(Address(Ipv4::any(), Port(8080)));
        auto router = std::make_shared<Rest::Router>();
        setupRoutes(router);
        endpoint.init(Http::Endpoint::options().threads(1));
        endpoint.setHandler(router->handler());
        endpoint.serve();
    }

private:
    void setupRoutes(Rest::Router& router) {
        Rest::Routes::Get(router, "/user/:id", Rest::Routes::bind(&UserService::getUser, this));
        Rest::Routes::Post(router, "/user", Rest::Routes::bind(&UserService::createUser, this));
    }

    void getUser(const Rest::Request& request, Http::ResponseWriter response) {
        auto id = request.param(":id").as<int>();
        Json::Value user;
        user["id"] = id;
        user["name"] = "John Doe";
        response.send(Http::Code::Ok, user.toStyledString());
    }

    void createUser(const Rest::Request& request, Http::ResponseWriter response) {
        Json::Reader reader;
        Json::Value user;
        reader.parse(request.body(), user);
        // Simulate saving user to a database
        response.send(Http::Code::Created, "User created successfully");
    }
};

int main() {
    UserService service;
    service.init();
}
```

This `UserService` listens on port `8080` and provides endpoints to create and retrieve users.

#### 2. Other Services
Other services would follow a similar pattern but with specific logic for their roles. Here’s a brief overview of each service:

- **Product Service**: Listens on port `8081`, provides `/product/:id` to get product details, and `/product` to add a new product.
- **Inventory Service**: Listens on port `8082`, provides `/inventory/:productId` to check stock and `/inventory` to update stock.
- **Order Service**: Listens on port `8083`, provides `/order/:id` to retrieve order status and `/order` to place an order.
- **Payment Service**: Listens on port `8084`, provides `/payment` endpoint for processing payments.
- **Notification Service**: Listens on port `8085`, provides `/notify` to send notifications.
- **Shipping Service**: Listens on port `8086`, provides `/ship/:orderId` to track shipment and `/ship` to create shipping requests.
- **Cart Service**: Listens on port `8087`, provides `/cart/:userId` to retrieve a user’s cart and `/cart` to add items.
- **Review Service**: Listens on port `8088`, provides `/review/:productId` to get reviews and `/review` to submit a new review.
- **Analytics Service**: Listens on port `8089`, aggregates and provides reports at `/report`.

Each service would use a similar structure, but with specific endpoints and data processing for their functions.

### Communication Between Services
In a microservices architecture, services often need to communicate with each other. For example:

- **Order Service** calls **Inventory Service** to check stock before placing an order.
- **Order Service** also calls **Payment Service** for payment processing.
- **Notification Service** sends an email after an order is placed.

In C++, services can use HTTP requests to communicate with each other. For instance, the Order Service might use `libcurl` to make a REST call to the Inventory Service.

```cpp
#include <curl/curl.h>
#include <iostream>

void checkInventory(int productId) {
    CURL* curl;
    CURLcode res;

    curl = curl_easy_init();
    if(curl) {
        std::string url = "http://inventory-service:8082/inventory/" + std::to_string(productId);
        curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, url.c_str());
        res = curl_easy_perform(curl);
        if(res != CURLE_OK) {
            std::cerr << "curl_easy_perform() failed: " << curl_easy_strerror(res) << std::endl;
        }
        curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
    }
}
```

This code snippet shows how **Order Service** could check the inventory for a specific product by making a REST API call to **Inventory Service**.

### Deployment
Each service can be containerized using Docker to ensure they can be deployed independently and communicate via network calls.

A simple Dockerfile for the **User Service** could look like this:

```dockerfile
# Dockerfile for User Service
FROM gcc:latest

WORKDIR /app
COPY . .

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y libpistache-dev libjsoncpp-dev
RUN g++ user_service.cpp -o user_service -lpistache -ljsoncpp

EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["./user_service"]
```

To deploy all services, you could use Docker Compose or Kubernetes. Here’s a simple example of a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  user-service:
    build:
      context: ./UserService
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"

  product-service:
    build:
      context: ./ProductService
    ports:
      - "8081:8081"

  inventory-service:
    build:
      context: ./InventoryService
    ports:
      - "8082:8082"
  
  # Define other services similarly
```

### Summary
This example illustrates a simple setup for a C++ application with 10 microservices:

1. Each service handles a specific functionality.
2. REST API is exposed by each service using Pistache or another HTTP library.
3. `libcurl` or similar tools can be used for inter-service communication.
4. Docker is used for containerizing each microservice.
5. Docker Compose (or Kubernetes) manages deployment and orchestration.

This approach allows each service to be developed, deployed, and scaled independently, aligning with the microservices architecture principles.
