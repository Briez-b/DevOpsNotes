# Python worksapces

Python workspaces refer to the environment in which you develop and run your Python code. They include the Python interpreter, installed libraries, and the current working directory. Understanding workspaces is essential for managing dependencies and code organization.

Python workspaces can be local or virtual environments. A local environment is the system-wide Python installation, while a virtual environment is an isolated environment for a specific project. You can create virtual environments using tools like `virtualenv` or `venv`.

**Example:**

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv myenv

# Activate the virtual environment (on macOS/Linux)
source myenv/bin/activate
```

Once activated, you work in an isolated workspace with its Python interpreter and library dependencies.

To get arguments for python script I can use module `sys`
