## 1. What is AWS ECS?

AWS ECS is a fully managed container orchestration service that allows you to run Docker containers at scale. It eliminates the need to manage your own container orchestration infrastructure and provides a highly scalable, reliable, and secure environment for deploying and managing your applications.

## 2. Why Choose ECS Over Other Container Orchestration Tools?

Before diving deep into ECS, let's compare it with some popular alternatives like Kubernetes and Docker Swarm.

### Comparison with Kubernetes:

Kubernetes is undoubtedly a powerful container orchestration tool with a vast ecosystem, but it comes with a steeper learning curve. ECS, on the other hand, offers a more straightforward setup and is tightly integrated with other AWS services, making it a preferred choice for AWS-centric environments.

### Comparison with Docker Swarm:

Docker Swarm is relatively easy to set up and is suitable for small to medium-scale deployments. However, as your application grows, ECS outshines Docker Swarm in terms of scalability, reliability, and seamless integration with AWS features like IAM roles and CloudWatch.

## 3. ECS Fundamentals

To understand ECS better, let's explore its core components:

### Clusters:

A cluster is a logical grouping of EC2 instances or Fargate tasks on which you run your containers. It acts as the foundation of ECS, where you can deploy your services.

### Task Definitions:

Task Definitions define how your containers should run, including the Docker image to use, CPU and memory requirements, networking, and more. It is like a blueprint for your containers.

### Tasks:

A task represents a single running instance of a task definition within a cluster. It could be a single container or multiple related containers that need to work together.

### Services:

Services help you maintain a specified number of running tasks simultaneously, ensuring high availability and load balancing for your applications.

## 4. Pros of Using AWS ECS

- **Fully Managed Service**: AWS handles the underlying infrastructure, making it easier for you to focus on deploying and managing applications.

- **Seamless Integration**: ECS seamlessly integrates with other AWS services like IAM, CloudWatch, Load Balancers, and more.

- **Scalability**: With support for Auto Scaling, ECS can automatically adjust the number of tasks based on demand.

- **Cost-Effective**: You pay only for the AWS resources you use, and you can take advantage of cost optimization features.

## 5. Cons of Using AWS ECS

- **AWS-Centric**: If you have a multi-cloud strategy or already invested heavily in another cloud provider, ECS's tight integration with AWS might be a limitation.

- **Learning Curve for Advanced Features**: While basic usage is easy, utilizing more advanced features might require a deeper understanding.

- **Limited Flexibility**: Although ECS can run non-Docker workloads with EC2 launch types, it is primarily optimized for Docker containers.

## 6. Installation and Configuration

Let's get our hands dirty and set up AWS ECS step-by-step.

### Prerequisites:

- An AWS account with appropriate IAM permissions.
- The AWS CLI and ECS CLI installed on your local machine.

### Setting Up ECS CLI:

ECS CLI is a command-line tool that simplifies the process of creating and managing ECS resources.

```bash
$ ecs-cli configure --region <region> --access-key <access-key> --secret-key <secret-key> --cluster <cluster-name>
```

### Configuring AWS Credentials:

Ensure you have the necessary AWS credentials configured using `aws configure` command.

## 7. Deploying Your First Application on ECS

In this section, we'll deploy a simple web application using ECS.

### Preparing the Application:

1. Create a Dockerfile for your web application.
2. Build the Docker image and push it to Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry).

### Creating a Task Definition:

Define the task using the ECS CLI or the AWS Management Console.

### Configuring the Service:

Create an ECS service to manage the desired number of tasks and set up load balancing.

### Deploying the Service:

Use the ECS CLI or the AWS Management Console to deploy the service.

### Monitoring the Service:

Monitor your ECS service using AWS CloudWatch metrics and logs.

## 8. Conclusion

In conclusion, AWS ECS offers a robust and user-friendly platform for deploying and managing containerized applications. We covered the fundamentals of ECS, compared it with its alternatives, discussed its pros and cons, and walked through the installation, configuration, and deployment of a sample application.

# PRACTICE

1) Create ECS cluster:

2) Create ECR repository to push the build to there:

![](../Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020241212120245.png)

Login to it in cli to be able to push own images:

Build and push the image:

3) Create a task definition with this image (it is like yaml file for pods in kubernetes).

Now we have created task definition, so we can run it to execute our container.

Choose the cluster we created before:

Now we have container run in ECS cluster:

I also added inbound rule to access the app using public IP of this task:

And now app accessible
